## Tasks
1. Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA)
- Derive kernel density maps of functional and non-functional water points. Using appropriate tmap functions,
- Display the kernel density maps on openstreetmap of Osub State, Nigeria.
- Describe the spatial patterns revealed by the kernel density maps. Highlight the advantage of kernel density map over point map.

2. Second-order Spatial Point Patterns Analysis
- Formulate the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis and select the confidence level.
- Perform the test by using appropriate Second order spatial point patterns analysis technique.
- With reference to the analysis results, draw statistical conclusions.

3. Spatial Correlation Analysis
Confirm statistically if the spatial distribution of functional and non-functional water points are independent from each other.

- Formulate the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis and select the confidence level.
- Perform the test by using appropriate Second order spatial point patterns analysis technique.
- With reference to the analysis results, draw statistical conclusions.

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
